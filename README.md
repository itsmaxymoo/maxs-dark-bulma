# Max's Dark Bulma Theme

My personal dark theme for my Bulma sites. **Note:** This theme
is highly incomplete as it only includes the tweaks for elements
of my sites. Use at your own risk!

## Installation

1. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsmaxymoo/Maxs-Dark-Bulma-Theme/main/maxs-dark-bulma.sass) `maxs-dark-bulma.sass`
2. Include in your project, before Bulma:

```sass
// Import theme
@import "maxs-dark-bulma"

// Import the rest of bulma...
```

## Design

This theme aims to be a dark theme with red-orange accents, and squared edges.
